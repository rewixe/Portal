Hello and welcome to the Overseas Study Portal. Here you will find valuable 
and practical information on studying abroad as an undergraduate student. 
This portal provides details on the locations that you can travel to, and some of
the institutions you can attend. As an undergraduate student, you have the option
to study a complete programme at a foreign institute in a different country, or 
alternatively you can simply study at an institution of your choice for a single 
semester.

As part of a successful experience of studying overseas, we hope to ensure that all 
students who decide to study abroad can use this portal to better infrom themselves
on the many different options that are availlable to them. We also hope to give
prospective undergraduate students and idea of possibilities in other countries.
