As part of your overseas study you can study in Europe, in countries such as the UK,
France, Germany, Spain, and Sweden. Alternatively you can study outside of Europe.
Overseas study is generally co-ordinated by the institution you attend in your home 
country. You can ask representatives at your college for information about
studying abroad, and about special partnerships your institution may have with 
countries outside of Europe. Most undergraduate students who study abroad, study in
a European country for a semester. You can also study a full programme in another
country. Regarding fees, you will pay the fees at the institution in your home country.
