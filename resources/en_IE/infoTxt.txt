As an undergraduate student you can study to complete either a full programme or
you can study for a shorter period of time. Under the European Commission's
Erasmus programme students can study in other European countries without the need for
a student visa. You can also receive special grants which will help you to pay for
your time abroad. These grants will come from your home country rather than your 
prospective host country. You may  choose to study outside Europe. In general, 
any study outside of Europe is organised by the third level institute you attend, and 
usually your institution will have a partnership with the host instituion to make 
studying there as a foreign student easier. More information about exchanges outside of
Europe can normally be found on the website of the host institution
