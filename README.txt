Software for the Global market 2 - Assignment

For this assignment I have created a portal for students looking to study abroad.

The language used to create this portal is python, and this program can be run using the
IDLE IDE. I also used CSS for this assignment, the .css file is called 'portal.css'.

This assignment also makes use of external resource files which must be located in the 
same folder as the code. The resource folder is called 'resources' and it contains 
the subfolders 'en_IE', 'ph_PH', and 'pl_PL'. These contain the resource files for the 
English, Filipino, and Polish cultural options respectively. Within each of these
subfolders there are several .txt files, and a .gif file of an image of a flag.
